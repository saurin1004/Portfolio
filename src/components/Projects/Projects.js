              description="A cloud-native face recognition system that dynamically scales from 0 to 15 AWS EC2 instances using custom auto-scaling logic. Built with Python, Flask, and PyTorch, it leverages SQS for decoupled messaging and S3 for storage, enabling cost-efficient, fault-tolerant, and consistently high-throughput processing. The system sustains 100+ concurrent requests with sub-1.2s latency, intelligently scaling down to zero when completely idle for optimal efficiency."
